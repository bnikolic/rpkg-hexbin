o   The new 3D plots -- should rather make the new functions "internal"
    and choosable with *arguments* from given functions !

o   hexbin  *class*  {as mentioned by  man/hexbin.Rd }		-- done

o   find the references (on paper) and read !
	     --> "References" in ./Biocore-notes

o   example(hmatplot)  is still doing many pages instead of one

o   Implement conversions between different hexagon coordinate systems

o   Smoothing on a hexagonal basis using tensor products
    + smoothing histograms
    + smoothing the intensity of a Poisson process

o   Family of hex apply functions

o   Hbin list class and constructors

---

o   Use standard convertColor() function more and
    and try to get rid of dependency on 'colorspace'
